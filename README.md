### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I am a business development manager and UX designer (on the side) learning the ins and outs of web development in pursuit of a full unicorn ðŸ¦„ title.

Currently living in Seoul, South Korea I work at AUTOCRYPT creating connections with partners, looking for creative ways to expand the business and help in the design of new products, for a more secure mobility.
