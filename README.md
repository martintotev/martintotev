### Good evening and hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I am a UX designer and web developer but not yet a full unicorn ðŸ¦„.

Currently living in Seoul, South Korea I work at AUTOCRYPT creating connections with partners, looking for creative ways to expand the business and help in the design of new products, for a more secure mobility.
